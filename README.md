# Bluesky Quicklaunch
A quick and dirty script that allows you to pick from a group of select Bluesky machines you designate for faster access. 

The computer list file needs to either live in the same folder as the script OR you can hardcode a path for it in the script if you dare.

Entry formatting for the list is csv: `Friendly Machine Name,id#,username`

`Friendly Machine Name` is purely for how it will appear in the list.

`id#` is the bluesky ID number, as found in your admin page.

`username` is a username you'd like defaulted into the process. If not provided, bluesky admin will just ask you.
